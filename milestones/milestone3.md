## Reflection

### 1. What went well during this unit?

I was able to shift the project to a new direction. 

### 2. What were some challenges your group faced in this unit?

It took time to recomplete all of the previous steps. 

### Did you finish all of your tasks in your sprint plan for this week? If you did not finish all of the planned tasks, how would you prioritize the remaining tasks on your list?

No, I did not. I will focus on making a minimal viable product that follows the requirements. 

### Which features and user stories would you consider “at risk”? How will you change your plan if those items remain “at risk”?

I think adding the customer support page and search might be at risk. I will likely not add them. 

### 5. What additional support will you need in upcoming units as you continue to work on your final project?

I just need to work on the project the rest of this week.
